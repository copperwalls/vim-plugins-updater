vim-plugins-updater
===================

Update your [Vim](http://vim.org/) plugins super easily.

This is meant to be used with [vim-plugins-installer](https://github.com/copperwalls/vim-plugins-installer). Of course, I could’ve included this there but it would be a misnomer, no? :)

Requirements
------------

Latest Vim, Git, and an environment where [vim-plugins-installer](https://github.com/copperwalls/vim-plugins-installer) was used. (Or something similar to it.)

How
---

Just clone/download the files then run the updater:

    ./update-vim-plugins.sh

Included files
--------------

- update-vim-plugins.sh — The updater (Bash script)
- README.md — This very document
- MIT-License.txt — License file (Contents also found at end of this document)

Contributing
------------

It’s a small script. I’m sure there’s a big room for improvement. If you can improve it, I encourage you to do so. Of course, you don’t have to get your hands dirty. If you have an idea, just let me know. If I see fit to add it, I’ll even write the code myself.
